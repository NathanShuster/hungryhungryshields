This bad boy is a 'snake' clone developed in PyGame, but I swapped out the head for a picture of my high school science teacher (Dr. Shields) and the 'cubes' and sound effects for bacon (the name of our high school science club, BACON, the Best All-round Club of Nerds). Hope someone else out there enjoys this half as much as I do. :)

Also, major credit for this goes to Al Sweigart and his excellent book on PyGame programming. This is basically a modified version of one of the programs in his book, which I would encourage anyone interested to <a href="https://inventwithpython.com/pygame/"> check out. </a>
